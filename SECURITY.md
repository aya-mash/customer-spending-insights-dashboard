# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities publicly in Issues or Pull Requests.

Instead, email: security@example.com (placeholder â€” update with a real monitored address.)

Provide:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce / proof of concept
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and keep you informed of remediation progress.

## Scope
This policy applies to all code in this repository. Third-party dependencies should be reported upstream when the issue originates there.

## Responsible Disclosure
We kindly ask that you:
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof of concept.
- Do not access, modify, or delete data you do not own.
- Give us reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
